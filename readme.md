usage: sshuserenumeration.py [-h] [-u USER | -U USERLIST] [-e] [-s]
                             [--bytes BYTES] [--samples SAMPLES]
                             [--factor FACTOR] [--trials TRIALS]
                             host

positional arguments:
  host                  Give SSH server address like ip:port or just by ip

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u USER, --user USER  Give a single user name
  -U USERLIST, --userlist USERLIST
                        Give a file containing a list of users
  -e, --enumerated      Only show enumerated users
  -s, --silent          Like -e, but just the user names will be written to
                        stdout (no banner, no anything)
  --bytes BYTES         Send so many BYTES to the SSH daemon as a password
  --samples SAMPLES     Collect so many SAMPLES to calculate a timing baseline
                        for authenticating non-existing users
  --factor FACTOR       Used to compute the upper timing boundary for user
                        enumeration
  --trials TRIALS       try to authenticate user X for TRIALS times and
                        compare the mean of auth timings against the timing
                        boundary
